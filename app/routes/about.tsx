              How is Kanjisense different from ______?
            </h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              The idea of learning the kanji via mnemonic keywords + component
              breakdowns is nothing new. Numerous comparable kanji-learning
              systems have popped up over the years in the form of books like
              Forster and Tamura's <i>Kanji ABC</i>, De Roo's <i>2001 Kanji</i>,
              and, most notably, Heisig's <i>Remembering the Kanji</i>.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Kanjisense was born out of my personal yearning for a similar
              resource that:
            </p>
            <ol className="mb-4 ml-8 list-decimal">
              <li>
                <span className="font-bold">
                  takes advantage of modern technology.
                </span>
                <br />
                Seriously, who can be bothered to look up a kanji in a dead-tree
                book these days?
              </li>
              <li>
                <span className="font-bold">
                  tells the real story of the characters' ancient origins.
                </span>
                <br />
                In particular, Heisig's <i>Remembering the Kanji</i> can get
                pretty silly in its choices for component keywords. Kanjisense
                isn't above the occasional silly mnemonic device, but it also
                makes room for discussions of{" "}
                <BrowseSoundComponentsLink>
                  sound components
                </BrowseSoundComponentsLink>
                , and sometimes even ancient character forms.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Besides those key differences, Kanjisense is more of a reference
              work than a course of study. The authors of{" "}
              <i>Remembering the Kanji</i> and <i>Kanji ABC</i> recommend you
              power through their books and memorize a list of 2,000 kanji in
              their proprietary order. I know from experience that I don't have
              the sheer willpower it takes to memorize 2,000 characters out of
              context, so I'll hold off from making such recommendations here.

            <p className="mb-4">
              Instead of a list to memorize, I present you with the same
              information and tools that have helped me the most on my own
              continuing kanji journey.
